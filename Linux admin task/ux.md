* use one color sharpie for drawing init sketch as we tend to focus on
  details (like color, line thicknes) when we should really focus on
  functionality details [1]
* when client comes and wants an app but have no idea what that app
  should do, sit him with designers, developers, domain owners (people
  who know about the problem most) to groups of 3-4 people. Give each 
  group pencils, creyons, sharpies, stickers papers scissors and Let
  each  group drow their own ideas independantly, then compare ideas.
  (sit developer, designer, domain owner, client, ... mix them up)
  this session should not took more then 4h [2]
* if a client has no idea what he wants tell them to imagine if they had 
  limitlesss money limitless time what that app would do (GPS, video,..)
  and then gradually throw away stuff that's not necesary [2]
* who is the user ? personality, would he be able to use the design ?
  * [2]
  * create one A5 page with details like
    * what platforms they use, what device, ...
    * give them names (peter => it, jane => grandma, ...) you can use this
      domain in code Factories
    * put a picture that represents user personality
      (representing user (grandma, kind, ..) next to design 
    * do they work alone or together ?
* sharpie sketch > creyons sketch > wireframe > Fireworks graphic > then
  coding HTML & CSS and backend
* if the project is large, create cards with a name of every bid of
  functionality the application should have (it can be even 250 cards)
  then give them to "the group" to sort them in relative grups.
  Now you have better mental model that seems logical to them
  Next give same excercise to another group, if they will end up with
  same thing.
    * Basically you end up with with fundamental menu/submenu
    * if something ends up in diferent card groups, maybe it have to be 
      in both
    * [2]
    * be careful to not to reinvent the wheel, there are concepts that
      people are use to
* make levels
  * [2]
  * forms (wizzard, not one long form)
  * levels of setting
